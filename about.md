# About Me
Hello! I am Bella. I'm 16, some of my hobbies are painting, crocheting, knitting, drawing, and 3d animation. I consider myself to be more of an artistic person but I also thoroughly enjoy solving math problems and logic puzzles. Also in my free time I like listening to music while reading or watching tv shows, and cooking or baking for my family. Some fun facts about me are that I play the violin, and the guitar (and I'm currently learning how to play the piano!), my favorite color is red, I have 1 older sister, and my favorite type of food is seafood.

My top career choice is dental hygienist because it is the path I am already working towards, and it provides a salary that can comfortably support my desired lifestyle. It is also practical and achievable within a few years of training. This career connects to my lifestyle goals because it offers a stable income above my projected needs and aligns with my personal values of helping people and contributing to their health. The skills from this computer science course will also help me succeed. Strong communication is essential for explaining oral health to patients, while time management and collaboration will allow me to stay on schedule and contribute to a positive workplace environment. Problem-solving and adaptability will help me work more efficiently and handle challenges in a professional setting.
